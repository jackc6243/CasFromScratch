# CasFromScratch

Hi this is a computer algebra system that I'm trying to build from scratch.
It currently supports:
- Tokeniser/parser from string to syntax tree
- Solve for x (e.g. 6*(x-3) = 26 )
- Differentiation (e.g. differentiating sin(ln(x^2+2)+4*x) )
- Numerical integration


To play around. Go to the tests folder and change up the different tests
